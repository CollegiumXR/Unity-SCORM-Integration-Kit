# Unity-SCORM-Integration-Kit
Integrate Unity3d Projects with your LMS via SCORM

Note: Since Unity3D transitioned from the WebPLayer plugin to using WebGL, updates have been required to the SCORM Integration kit.
The previous version (WebPLayer version) has been kept for archive purposes.
For all new integration, please use the Project and/or unity packaged marked with a postfix of "WebGL".
